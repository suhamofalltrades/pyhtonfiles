There's no such thing as free lunch.
Throw caution to the wind.
In the boundless expanse of the cosmos, where stars ignite and galaxies collide, lies the enigmatic tapestry of existence. Here, amidst the silent ballet of celestial bodies, unfolds a saga of epic proportions. Within the confines of a lone spacecraft, a cadre of intrepid explorers, draped in futuristic garb, engage in fervent discourse while monitoring their instruments. Helm adjusts trajectory to skirt the event horizon of a black hole, while tense glances exchange among the crew, cognizant of the perilous voyage. Sensors detect anomalous energy fluctuations, possibly a wormhole, prompting preparations for evasive maneuvers to evade subspace's abyss. Distress signals from a neighboring star system alert the crew to an alien onslaught, thrusting them into battle. Laser cannons ablaze, explosions rend the cosmic fabric as shields wane and the crew, undeterred, deploys the quantum destabilizer. Amidst victory's respite, a temporal rift unravels, ensnaring the vessel and propelling it through the maelstrom of time and space, leaving uncertainty and stardust in its wake.
You cannot have your cake and eat it too.
How does that sound.
That sounds great.
Better late than never.
Speak of the devil.
Once in a blue moon.
You cannot judge a book by its cover.
To feel under the weather.
A piece of cake.
Let the cat out of the bag.
Call it a day.
Getting a taste of your own medicine.
The last straw.
At the eleventh hour.
A blessing in disguise.
Rome was not built in a day.
Garlic is not sour.
You, are great.
Three birds with one stroke.
The first world war took place in 1914.
There are 195 countries in the world.
A dozen is a group of 12.
Suham, is a great guy.
Bite the bullet.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Your guess is as good as mine.
